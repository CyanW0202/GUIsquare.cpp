# CPP-5G-Network-Sim

A 5G Networking Simulator.

## Description

### 2020
The simulator models a SDNs, generate E-UTRAN Node B(Enode B) basestations
1. MIMO Antennas 
..* transceivers, mini antennas and sectors.
2. Basestation Data
..* Direction, Signal Strength, and location of UE(user devices)

The simulator realistically models channel conditions, power calculation, key performance indicators (KPIs), and BaseStation (BS) to User Equipment (UE) interactions. By measuring the KPIs of a specific UE and detecting the status of nearby BSs, optimal algorithmic decisions can be made by the network manager to transfer users from one BS to another. By doing so, the network can optimize and heal itself when unfavorable events or conditions occur.

This project uses the [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) library for the GUI.
