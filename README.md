# CPP-5G-Network-Sim

A 5G Networking Simulator.

## Description

A virtual environment resembling situations that 5G cellular towers will encounter in the real world. By testing self-healing and SON management techniques, this simulator generates realistic data sets that can be analyzed. The simulator realistically models channel conditions, power calculation, key performance indicators (KPIs), and BaseStation (BS) to User Equipment (UE) interactions. By measuring the KPIs of a specific UE and detecting the status of nearby BSs, optimal algorithmic decisions can be made by the network manager to transfer users from one BS to another. By doing so, the network can optimize and heal itself when unfavorable events or conditions occur.

This project uses the [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) library for the GUI.
